# AstroLabs - Blood Diagnostic Tool

AstroLabs is an advanced tool for the remote analysis of biological samples in space. Its goal is to provide instant health diagnostics to astronauts through an intelligent system that utilizes three interconnected devices: one for extracting blood, another for analyzing it, and a third for processing data using AI to generate a virtual replica of the biological sample. This all occurs without the need to physically return the sample to Earth, efficiently sending observations and detailed data. This website is a simulation of how the AstroLabs AI would function, focusing on pattern recognition and diagnosis.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Use the "Choose File" button to select an image of a blood sample.
2. **Diagnose**: Click the "Diagnose" button to start the analysis.
3. **Progress Bar**: A loading bar will appear, taking between 6 to 9 seconds to complete.
4. **Results**: After loading, the application will display the diagnostic results, including:
   - The diagnosed condition.
   - Explanation of how the diagnosis was made.
   - Additional information about the condition.
